## Welcome to Microsoft Imagine's Halo 5 API Activity
Hello from the [Microsoft Imagine team](http://imagine.microsoft.com)! Thanks for checking out our activity using the **Halo 5 API**.  Learn how to use this API in your own site and show player stats!

## Microsoft Imagine?
Microsoft Imagine gives you the tools you need to experiment, explore, and launch your ideas.  Learn the basics of coding and you can create anything you dream. See where you can take code, and where coding can take you.  

## What is this?
![website sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Imagine_halo-5-api/blob/master/Halo5SampleSite.png)

This repository holds the assets and JavaScript source code for this **Halo 5 API** activity. 

If you're new to JavaScript or just need some guidance overall, [head to the Halo 5 API activity page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/imagine/imagine-create031) on the [Microsoft Imagine site](http://imagine.microsoft.com) and follow our steps in the embedded Office Mix to complete the code for your own version of the website.

Otherwise, feel free to use our Halo 5 API activity code and assets to start your own version of a Halo 5 stats website, and develop the skills to turn your own ideas into something real.  

## How do I start?
To get started with the Halo 5 API, you'll want to install the following:
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [Windows Installer for Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)

The [Halo 5 API activity's Office Mix](https://msdn.microsoft.com/imagine/imagine-create031) has installation instructions if you need them.

## How do I use GitHub Desktop to get this?
Never done this before and just want the files to work with on your own? 

Click on the small **Clone in Desktop** button and you'll make a copy of all of these files on your machine that you can work with.  Alternatively, **Download ZIP** and then unzip the files in a familiar location on your computer.

Remember where you save these files, so you can find them again in Visual Studio!
